# Z.files

Various dotfiles and preference files that I want to keep around ðŸ•¶

## Tasks

In a perfect world, I would simply run `zetup.zsh` and everything works, but the amount of time it takes to perfect a setup script is _so_ much longer than the actual time it takes to setup a new laptop. Hence, for the once every couple years I need to do so:
